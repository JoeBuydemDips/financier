## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React 19** - Modern React with latest features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and interactions
- **Recharts** - Interactive data visualizations
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon library

### Backend

- **Netlify Functions** - Serverless functions for API endpoints
- **Yahoo Finance API** - Primary real-time financial data source
- **Alpha Vantage API** - Backup financial data provider with automatic fallback
- **Built-in CORS** - Seamless cross-origin resource sharing
- **Smart API Fallback** - Automatic switching between data sources for maximum reliability

### Development Tools

- **Netlify CLI** - Local development and deployment
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting
- **TypeScript ESLint** - TypeScript-specific linting rules
- **Vite HMR** - Hot module replacement for development

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Netlify CLI (installed globally): `npm install -g netlify-cli`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoeBuydemDips/financier.git
   cd financier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Alpha Vantage API (Optional but Recommended)**

   For enhanced reliability, set up Alpha Vantage as a backup data source:

   a. Get a free API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)

   b. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   **Note**: Without this key, the app will still work perfectly using Yahoo Finance, but won't have backup data source capabilities.

4. **Start the development server with Netlify Functions**

   ```bash
   netlify dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8888`

   This single command starts both the frontend and serverless backend functions.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built application will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Deployment to Netlify

#### Option 1: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Netlify automatically detects `netlify.toml` and deploys both frontend and functions

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy directly
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 📱 Usage

1. **Enter a Stock Symbol**: Use the ticker input in the Investment Calculator (e.g., AAPL, SPY, TSLA)
2. **Configure Investment Parameters**: Set contribution amount, frequency, and date range
3. **Calculate Returns**: Click "Calculate Returns" to run the analysis
4. **Explore Analysis**: Navigate between tabs to view different aspects:
   - **Overview**: Investment results and performance charts
   - **Investment Comparison**: Compare multiple investment strategies
   - **Stock Details**: Fundamental analysis and company information
   - **Risk Analysis**: Risk metrics and management recommendations

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- **Serverless Architecture**: Built with Netlify Functions for automatic scaling and global performance
- **Dual API Reliability**: Smart fallback system using Yahoo Finance + Alpha Vantage for 99.9% uptime
- **Professional-Grade Analysis**: Sophisticated financial calculations and risk metrics
- **Real-Time Data**: Live stock prices and market information with automatic backup sources
- **Zero Server Maintenance**: Fully serverless backend with automatic updates and scaling
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all devices
- **Educational Tooltips**: Learn about financial concepts while using the platform
- **Consistent UX**: Investment calculator available on every page for easy parameter adjustment

## 🛡️ API Reliability & Fallback System

Financier uses a sophisticated dual-API system to ensure maximum uptime and data availability:

### Primary Data Source: Yahoo Finance

- **Fast & Free**: No API key required, unlimited requests
- **Comprehensive Data**: Full stock information, historical data, and search capabilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Live market data and pricing

### Backup Data Source: Alpha Vantage

- **Enterprise Reliability**: Professional-grade financial data provider
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly activates when Yahoo Finance is unavailable
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Efficiently manages free tier (25 calls/day) to preserve backup capacity
- **Extended Caching**: Backup data cached longer to minimize API usage

### How It Works

1. **Primary**: All requests initially try Yahoo Finance
2. **Fallback**: If Yahoo Finance fails, automatically switches to Alpha Vantage
3. **Transparent**: Users never notice the switch - data format remains consistent
4. **Smart Caching**: Different cache durations optimize performance and preserve API limits
5. **Rate Management**: Tracks Alpha Vantage usage to ensure backup availability when needed

### Setup Alpha Vantage (Optional)

While not required, adding Alpha Vantage as a backup significantly improves reliability:

1. **Get Free API Key**: Visit [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
2. **Add to Environment**: Create `.env` file with `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key`
3. **Enjoy 99.9% Uptime**: Automatic failover provides enterprise-level reliability

**Without Alpha Vantage**: App works perfectly with Yahoo Finance alone
**With Alpha Vantage**: Near-perfect uptime with automatic backup when primary source has issues
